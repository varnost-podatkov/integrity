/**
 * TASK:
 * We want to send a large chunk of data from Alice to Bob while maintaining its integrity and considering
 * the limitations of communication channels -- we have three such channels:
 * - Alice to Bob: an insecure channel, but has high bandwidth and can thus transfer large files
 * - Alice to Public Space: a secure channel, but has low bandwidth and can only transfer small amounts of data
 * - Bob to Public Space: a secure channel, but has low bandwidth and can only transfer small amounts of data
 * <p>
 * The plan is to make use of the public-space technique:
 * - Alice creates the data and computes its digest
 * - Alice sends the data to Bob, and sends the encrypted digest to Public Space
 * - Channel between Alice and Public space is secured with ChaCha20-Poly1305 (Alice and Public space share
 * a ChaCha20 key)
 * - Public space forwards the digest to Bob
 * - The channel between Public Space and Bob is secured but with AES in GCM mode (Bob and Public space share
 * an AES key)
 * - Bob receives the data from Alice and the digest from Public space
 * - Bob computes the digest over the received data and compares it to the received digest
 * <p>
 * Further instructions are given below.
